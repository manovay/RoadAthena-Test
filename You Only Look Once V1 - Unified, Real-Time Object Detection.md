# Abstract
- **Goal:*** Prior object detection used classifiers, here we use a regression problem to spatially separate bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. In YOLO, one neural network predicts the boxes and probabilities directly from full images
- **Main Idea:****. Since this is one single network, it can be easily optimized for better performance.
- **Key Results:**  The base YOLO model processes images at 45 fps, smaller versions reach higher fps and all are doubling the metrics of other detectors. YOLO does make more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives. YOLO does learn general representations of objects, outperforming other methods such as DPM and R-CNN.

# 1. Introduction
The human visual system is fast and accurate as we can immediately categorize objects and where they are spatially/how they interact. Applying this to fields such as self driving cars would allow for the advent of general purpose, responsive robotic systems.
* Current detection systems - Repurpose classifiers, evaluate at various locations and scales in a test image.
	- Deformable Parts Models (DPM) - Use a sliding window approach where the classifier is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire image. 
	- R-CNN - Use regional proposal to generate bounding boxes and then run a classifier. *Then* post-processing is used to refine the bounding boxes, eliminate duplicate detections and rescore the boxes. 
	- As you can see, these pipelines are slow and hard to optimize as each component must be trained separately.
YOLO is different as the object detection is reframed a single regression problem, based off the image pixels which then are used to calculate the bounding box coordinates. A single CNN is used to predict the bounding boxes and class probabilities. (look below). YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes its performance. 
![[Pasted image 20251004144100.png]]
* YOLO Improvements : 
	* **Speed**: Since the pipeline is simple, we simple run the network on a new image at test time. The base networks run at 45 FPS with no batch processing on a Titan X GPU. In terms of impact, this means less than 25 MS of latency and twice the mean average precision of other real-time systems.
	* **Reasoning**: YOLO reasons glovally, unlike sliding windows it sees the entire image during training ang test time so it can deal with contextual information about classes. Fast R-CNN mistakes background patches in an image for objexts as it lacks context. YOLO makes less than half the number of background errors.
	* **Geranlizable**: Yolo is able to learn generalizable representation, and it out performed DPM and R-CNN by a wide margin when it came to natural images. Due to its generalizabel nature, it is less likely to break down when applied to new domains or unexpected outputs. 
* YOLO Issues:
	* Yolo still lags behind detection systems in accuracy as it cant quickly localize objects with precision, especially smaller ones.

# 2. Unified Detection

  $\quad$ YOLO unifies the separate components of object detection into a single neural network. This network predicts all bounding boxes across all classes for an image simultaneously. In effect the YOLO design allows for global reasoning for the full image and the objects in the image. 

- First, we divide the image into an *S x S* grid, where if the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object. 
- Next, each grid cell predicts *B* bounding boxes and confidence scores. These confidence scores show how confident the model is that the box contains the object and how accurate it thinks the box is. 

 $\quad$The formal confidence is defined as $Pr(\text{Object}) \times IOU_{\text{pred}}^{\text{truth}}$ . What this means is we are multiplying the probability of an object with the Intersection over Union (IOU). *The IOU measures how well the box fits over the actual objects position and size (overlap).* This confidence ensures that if there is no object in the cell then the confidence score should be equal to zero, or if there an object we want to see how well the IOU is between the predicted box and actual.

***Confidence and Class Probability Computation:***
- Each bounding box consists of 5 predictions: *x, y, w, h, confidence.* 
	- *(x,y)* represent the center of the box relative to the bounds of the grid cell. 
	- *(w,h)* are predicted relative to the entire image. 
	- *(confidence)* this is the IOU between the predicted box and the actual box 
- Each grid cell also predicts *C* conditional class probabilities for each of the *C* classes - $Pr(\text{Class}_i \mid \text{Object})$
	- The class vector is shared by all *B* boxes from the same cell. (Boxes decide where, the class probs decide what).
- Using one class vector per cell cuts compute time and reduces the duplicate predictions that might arise. 
- At test time, each box already has a confidence level ( $Pr(\text{Object}) \times IOU_{\text{pred}}^{\text{truth}}$ ). We multiply this with a **cell's conditional class probability** to get a **class-specific box score**:$$
Pr(\text{Class}_i \mid \text{Object}) \times Pr(\text{Object}) \times IOU_{\text{pred}}^{\text{truth}}
$$
* Using the definition of conditional probability, we can simplify this to:$$
Pr(\text{Class}_i) \times IOU_{\text{pred}}^{\text{truth}}
$$
* Thus, these scores are able to encode both the probability of the class appearing in the box and how well the box fits the object. 
* Sample workflow below - ![[Pasted image 20251004155816.png]]  
* Note the output TENSOR (3d or higher array), it follows this specific format *S x S x (B x 5 + C)* In this format, the S is the size of grid, B has the 5 values (x, y, w, h, confidence), and C has the conditional class probabilities.

## 2.1 Network Design
$\quad$ This model is implemented as a convolutional neural network and evaluated it on the Pascal VOC detection dataset. The initial convolutional layers extract features from the image and the fully connected layers predict the output probabilities and coordinates. 
$\quad$ The architecture is inspired by GoogLeNet model. There are 24 convolutional layers and 2 fully connecter layers. The full network is shown below:

> - **Maxpool layers:** Downsample (2×2 stride 2) → halve spatial dimensions while retaining key info.  
> - **Depth increases** (3 → 1024) as more complex features are captured; **width/height shrink** (448 → 7).
>

>
> **Final Layers:**
> - Fully connected layers (e.g., 4096 → 7×7×30) transform learned features into predictions.  
> - Final output tensor:  
>   $$
>   S \times S \times (B \times 5 + C) = 7 \times 7 \times 30
>   $$
> - Represents bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and class probabilities for all grid cells.
>
> ---
>
> **Interpretation:**  
> Early layers detect edges/textures, deeper layers capture object shapes, and the final layers predict bounding boxes and classes for the entire image.

$\quad$ There is also a fast version of YOLO which uses 9 convolutional layers, and fewer filters in the layers. Other than this, the training and test parameters are all the same between YOLO and Fast YOLO. Once again, the final output is 7 x 7 x 30 tensor of predictions.

## 2.2 Training
$\quad$ The model is pretrained on convolutional layers on the ImageNet 1000-class competition dataset. ImageNet has millions of labeled images, it teaches the network to recognize general visual features (*edges, shapes, textures, patterns*). This gives YOLO a strong feature extractor before detection training, giving the model a starting point for random weights which in turn speeds up future convergence/accuracy. 

$\quad$ After pretraining, they extend the model by adding 4 convolutional and 2 fully connected layers, which are randomly initialized. This increases the input resolution from 224 x 224 to 448 x 448 so the network can learn finer spatial details. This allows the model to focus more on spatial details, and localization. Thus, the model is now able to adapt to object detection not just what the object is. 

$\quad$- The bounding boxes (*x,y,w,h*) are normalized to \[0,1]\:
		- (*x,y*) = center of box relative to grid cell
		- (w,h) = box width/heigh relative to full image 

$\quad$ This keeps all the outputs in a consistent range, making training and gradients stable and comparable across all examples. We don't have to worry about an extreme coordinate value dominating the loss. 

$\quad$ The Leaky ReLU activation function is applied for the final layer, this avoids "dead neurons" (where gradients disappear for all negative inputs) and improves gradient flow. This occurs as we give the neurons <0 a small gradient (.1x) The function is:
$$
\phi(x) =
\begin{cases}
x, & \text{if } x > 0 \\
0.1x, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$\quad$ YOLO uses sum-squared error  to optimize its predictions. This makes optimization easy but it doesn't necessarily match the objective of maximizing precision. The limitation is that it treats all types of error the same. This means a small mistake in bounding box size can carry the same weight as a misclassification (which should be more). Additionally, if a cell does not contain an image, the confidence score is near 0, there are many of these cells and can easily overpower the gradient in comparison to the cells that actually contain objects. 

$\quad$ To remedy this, we increase the weight of errors of bounding box coordinates and reduce the weight of confidence errors for cells without objects. We use two parameters, $\lambda_{\text{coord}}$ and $\lambda_{\text{noobj}}$ to accomplish this. We set $\lambda_{\text{coord}} = 5$ and $\lambda_{\text{noobj}} = 0.5$. By setting these parameters to these rates, we are able to focus on boxes that actually contain objects and less on background noise. 
$\quad$ 
$\quad$There is another issue with errors in large boxes and small boxes, as a small error in a large box matters less than the same numerical error in a small box. This is handled by YOLO predicting the square root of the bounding box width and height instead of the width and height directly. 

$\quad$ Finally, YOLO predicts multiple bounding boxer per grid cell, it needs a way to determine which one is responsible for each object during training. The model is able to thus assign "responsibility" to the box which has the highest IOU (Intersection over Union) with the actual box. This allows the bounding box aspect to become more specialized and predict sizes, aspect ratios etc. 
#### $\quad$Loss Function: 
$\quad$ $\quad$ The loss function combines several objectives into a single sum-squared error term. As mentioned above it penalizes these 3 terms: 
$\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ - Bounding box (x,y,w,h)
$\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ - Confidence scores (model certainty of an object's existing )
$\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ - Classification probability (what class the model belongs to )
$\quad$ The total loss includes weighted sums of these components across all grid cells and bounding boxes, using these 2 key params to adjust balances. 
$\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\lambda_{\text{coord}} = 5$ --> Localization accuracy (bounding box coords)
$\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$  $\lambda_{\text{noobj}} = 0.5$ --> Reduces impact of confidence loss for cells w/ no objects

$$
1. **Localization Loss - Box Center (x,y) $$
\lambda_{\text{coord}} \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \sum_{j=0}^{B} 
\mathbf{1}_{ij}^{\text{obj}}
\Big[ (x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2 + (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \Big]
$$
	* **Goal** - Encourage the network to position bounding boxes precisely over objects. 
	* This is the term that penalizes the difference between predicted and true **center** values. This only applies to the boxes responsible for detecting an object, indicated by the mask $\mathbf{1}_{ij}^{\text{obj}}$ . We are iterating through each of the *S x S* cells and the *B* bounding boxes. 
	* The  $\lambda_{\text{coord}} = 5$  is also applied to this term to make localization accuracy important, by increasing the error of bounding box errors.

2. **Localization Loss - Box Dimensions (w,h) $$
\lambda_{\text{coord}} \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \sum_{j=0}^{B} 
\mathbf{1}_{ij}^{\text{obj}}
\Big[ (\sqrt{w_i} - \sqrt{\hat{w}_i})^2 + (\sqrt{h_i} - \sqrt{\hat{h}_i})^2 \Big]
$$
	* **Goal** - Ensures the boxes are proportionate and accurate over objects. 
	* This is the term that measures error in predicted weight and height of bounding boxes. YOLO uses the square root as it makes the error scale-sensitive. A small error in a large box is penalized less than a error of the same value in a small box. It also only applies to boxes that contain objects and it has the  $\lambda_{\text{coord}} = 5$   weight. 


3. **Confidence Loss - Object Present$$
\sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \sum_{j=0}^{B} 
\mathbf{1}_{ij}^{\text{obj}} (C_i - \hat{C}_i)^2
$$
	* **Goal** - Get the model to recognize the presence and fit (IOU) of detected objets
	* This term penalizes confidence prediction errors when an object is present in the grid cell. Confidence represents both objectness and IoU -  $Pr(\text{Object}) \times IOU_{\text{pred}}^{\text{truth}}$ , if the model predicts a low confidence for a real object this term will increase. 

4. **Confidence Loss - No object $$
\lambda_{\text{noobj}} \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \sum_{j=0}^{B} 
\mathbf{1}_{ij}^{\text{noobj}} (C_i - \hat{C}_i)^2
$$
	* **Goal:** Suppress confidence in background regions without overwhelming the total loss.
	* This is the term that penalizes false positives, where the model claims there is an object when there is not. Because most cells won't contain anything, this can easily dominate the total loss. Thus, we have attached the $\lambda_{\text{noobj}} = 0.5$ term to it, minimizing background influence. 
5. **Classification Loss — Class Probabilities**$$
\sum_{i=0}^{S^2} 
\mathbf{1}_{i}^{\text{obj}} 
\sum_{c \in \text{classes}} (p_i(c) - \hat{p}_i(c))^2
$$
      * **Goal**: Encourage correct object classification for detected boxes
      * This is the term that measures how accurately YOLO predicts the class of an object. It is computed only for cells that contain an object. The model seeks to minimize the squared difference between predicted class probabilities and the true labels. 

#### $\quad$Training :
$\quad$ This model was trained for 135 epochs on the Pascal VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets. The batch size was 64, the momentum was .9, and the weight decay was .0005. These ensure the gradient kept the "memory" of previous directions and overfitting was avoided by penalizing large weights. 

$\quad$The learning rate was gradually adjusted over time to maintain stability and prevent divergence:
		- **Warm-up**: Slowly increased from 10^-3 to 10^-2 over the first epochs. 
		- **Main training**: Used 10^-2 for the next 75 epochs 
		- **Fine tuning:** Reduced to 10^-3 for 30 epochs
		- **Final refinement**: Lower to 10^-4 for last 30 epochs  
		- This methodology let the model make big updates at first and then precise adjustments later on.
#### $\quad$ Regularization and Data Augmentation:
- **Dropout:**
    * Applied after the first fully connected layer with a **rate of 0.5**.
    * Randomly “drops” half of the neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation (over-reliance between neurons).
- **Data Augmentation:**
    * Random **scaling and translation** of up to **20%** of the image size.
    - Random **exposure and saturation** adjustments by a factor of **1.5×** in **HSV color space**.
    - These variations simulate real-world differences in object size, position, and lighting, making the model more robust to unseen data

## 2.3 Inference
$\quad$ During testing, YOLO works the same as it does during training, needing only one single pass through  the entire network. For each image, the network outputs 98 bounding boxes with class probabilities for each. Thus, YOLO is extremely fast compared to older, classifier-based methods that require multiple steps per image. **Grid based prediction** occurs as the image is divided into a grid and each grid cell predicts the bounding boxes. Usually, each object's center falls inside one grid cell, so that becomes the cell "responsible" for detecting it. For large objects or those between cells, nearby cells are used for detecting the object. **Duplicate detection*** is side stepped by applying NMS, it keeps the box with highest confidence and removes the other overlapping boxes. The use of NMS has raised YOLO's mean average precision (MAP) by 2-3%. 
>[!info] 2.3 Inference
>YOLO performs detection in one fast pass, predicts multiple boxes per image using a grid system, and refines its results with non-max suppression for slightly better accuracy.

## 2.4 Limitations
- **Spatial constraints** - YOLO divides the images into a grid where each grid cell can only predict 2 bounding boxes and one class label. This design makes it difficult for the model to detect multiple nearby objects in the same cell. As a result, YOLO can't distinguish multiple birds in a flock etc. 
- **Generalization Issues -** Because YOLO learns bounding box shapes directly from training data, it has trouble generalizing to objects with unusual shapes, aspect ratios, or configurations that differ from what it has seen before.
- **Feature Resolution** - YOLO’s architecture includes several downsampling layers (pooling and striding), which reduce spatial detail in deeper feature maps.
- **Loss function limitations** - Yolo's sum squared error treats all errors equally, regardless of object size. A small localization error in a large box is minor, but the same error in a small box can drastically reduce the IoU. Because of this, the main source of YOLO’s error is imprecise localization rather than misclassification.
# 3. Comparison to Other Detection Systems
- **Deformable Parts Model (DPM)**: Uses sliding windows and handcrafted features, YOLO replaces this with one CNN that handles all responsibilities end-to-end. Results in simpler, faster, more accurate model.
* **R-CNN**: Uses region proposals , CNN feature extraction and SVM classification. Very accurate but slow. YOLO is faster and unified and trained jointly rather than in separate stages. 
* **Faster R-CNN:** Improves speed using shared computation and learnt region proposals, but still not real-time. 
* **YOLO's Advantages:*** Throws out the pipeline, you only look ONCE. 
# 4. Experiments
- **Methodology:**
    - Trained a single, end-to-end convolutional network for real-time object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012.
    - Compared YOLO against traditional multi-stage detectors such as DPM, R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN.
    - Evaluated both detection accuracy (mAP) and inference speed (FPS).
    - Tested generalization to new domains using artwork datasets.
- **Results:**
    - Fast YOLO achieved real-time performance (~155 FPS) with moderate accuracy (~52.7 mAP).
    - Standard YOLO reached 63.4 mAP at 45 FPS, outperforming all other real-time systems.
    - Combining YOLO with Fast R-CNN increased overall accuracy to 75 mAP by reducing background false positives.
    - YOLO generalized better than R-CNN and DPM to non-natural images, showing stronger robustness.
- **Impact:**

    - Introduced true real-time, end-to-end detection using a single CNN.
    - Influenced the design of later, faster detectors such as SSD and future YOLO versions.

# 5. **Real-Time Detection in the Wild:**
- YOLO maintains real-time speed even when connected to a live **webcam**, including image capture and display time.
- The system is interactive and responsive, detecting objects continuously as they move and change appearance.
- Although YOLO processes frames independently, it behaves like a simple object tracker in practice.

- **Real-time detection:**  
    YOLO’s one-pass architecture makes it ideal for **on-road inference**, detecting objects like potholes, debris, signs, or pedestrians without lag.  
    This enables **live hazard alerts**, adaptive driving decisions, or smart road monitoring.
    
- **Unified design:**  
    The single-CNN pipeline simplifies deployment — no region proposal or post-processing pipeline is required.  
    Easier to integrate with **edge devices** or embedded GPUs used in traffic systems and autonomous platforms.
    
- **Global context reasoning:**  
    YOLO sees the entire frame, reducing false positives from background noise — useful for complex road scenes where lighting, shadows, or textures might confuse detectors.
    
- **Scalability:**  
    Works efficiently with standard datasets; can be retrained with **road-specific data** (potholes, road cracks, traffic lights, lane markings) to build a domain-specific model for Athena.
    
- **Speed–accuracy balance:**  
    Offers high enough FPS for **real-time roadside cameras or vehicle dashboards**, supporting 24/7 detection without major latency.

### **Potential Improvements**

- **Small-object detection:**  
    Original YOLO struggles with small, clustered objects (e.g., fine cracks, small debris). Later versions (YOLOv3–YOLOv8) use multi-scale detection and anchor boxes to fix this.
    
- **Higher localization accuracy:**  
    YOLOv1 has coarse feature maps due to downsampling. Using a **deeper backbone** or **feature pyramid networks (FPNs)** would improve bounding box precision for distant objects.
    
- **Better handling of dense scenes:**  
    For multi-object road scenes (e.g., heavy traffic), grid-based limitations can cause missed detections. Upgrading to models that allow **multiple objects per cell** improves recall.
    
- **Domain-specific fine-tuning:**  
    Retrain or fine-tune on curated **road anomaly datasets (e.g., IIT pothole, CRACK500)** to specialize the model’s feature space for infrastructure conditions.
    
- **Sensor fusion:**  
    Integrating YOLO outputs with **LiDAR or GPS metadata** can enhance localization and reduce false detections under poor lighting or occlusion.
